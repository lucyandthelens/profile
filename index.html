 <h1>About Me</h1>   
 <img src="file:///Users/lucyallen/Desktop/Lucy%202.jpg" alt="">
 <p> Hi I am Lucy and The Lens, freelance photographer, I have a masterâ€™s in photography at UCLAN. (The University of Central Lancashire). I specialise in <Em><strong>Headshots</strong></Em>, <em><strong>Fashion</strong></em> , and <em><strong>Portrait Photography</strong></em> .</p>
<p>My journey into photography started at a very young age from the moment I picked up a disposable camera at the age of 8 my passion ignited. I am mostly a self-taught photographer. The majority of my photographic work was taken on a compact camera until, I was gifted a DSLR camera for Christmas in 2014 which enabled me to take higher quality photos thus fuelling my enthusiasm for photography. Shortly after that at the start of 2015 I did a ten-week intro to photography course to develop my skills. I was able to enhance my skills through reading a variety of photography books such as read this if you want to take great photographs which provided me with a more in depth look into portrait photography and photography beyond auto by Chris Gatcum which gave me a deeper understanding of manual photo techniques.</p>
<p> Since joining Preston photographic society in 2015 I have worked with a variety of models, including solo shoots and workshops. I also enter monthly competitions and participate in photo walks. In the 2016/17 season I finished third overall in the novice category only one point behind the winner. In the February 2020 Competition I received a first place in the mono print category for my photo Tribal Woman which you can see below: <img src="/img/desktop/Tribal Woman" alt="">
<p>For me pictures evoke <em><strong>memories</strong></em> which enable you to look into the past. They capture the essence of a person or create a sense of mystery around them. If you book with me, I will endeavour to capture the essence you convey through your emotions.</p>
